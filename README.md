## Project 19: Topic Summarization and Clustering Application

**Description:** 

This Streamlit-based application offers an interactive interface for users to explore automated topic summarization and clustering. Built to handle multiple input topics, the app uses state-of-the-art language models and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate and analyze text summaries. The main components and functionalities of the application are as follows:

Topic Summarization:

- Users can input a list of topics to be summarized.
- The application leverages a large pre-trained language model from Hugging Face to generate concise summaries for each topic, ensuring relevance and comprehensiveness.
- As a reference point, summaries from Wikipedia are retrieved and used for comparison against the generated summaries.

Summary Validation:

The application employs two advanced metrics to validate the quality of the generated summaries:
- ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): Measures the overlap between the generated and reference summaries, emphasizing recall to ensure the generated summary captures critical information from the reference.
- BERTScore: A semantic similarity metric that compares the generated summary with the Wikipedia reference summary using BERT embeddings, offering a nuanced evaluation of content similarity.
Clustering Analysis:

To gain insights into the generated summaries, the app applies clustering analysis on the summaries based on their embeddings.
Using embeddings derived from Hugging Face’s models, the app groups similar summaries using DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), allowing flexible, shape-independent clustering.
Silhouette Score is calculated to evaluate the quality of the clusters, providing a measure of how well each topic summary fits within its assigned cluster.
