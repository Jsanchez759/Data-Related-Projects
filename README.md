## Project 1: Predictive Sales Analysis

**Description:** In this project, I used historical sales data to develop a predictive model for future sales. I applied time series analysis techniques, including ARIMA and Prophet, to forecast sales trends. The results are presented in an interactive dashboard using Plotly and Dash.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Dash, ARIMA, Prophet.

## Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction

**Description:** This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a subscription-based service. I used various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression and random forests, to build a predictive model. The project includes a Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis and model evaluation.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.

## Project 3: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

**Description:** In this computer vision project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images. The dataset includes a variety of images, and I used TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the CNN. The project includes both the code and a report with the results.

**Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Project 4: Natural Language Processing

**Description:** This NLP project involved sentiment analysis of customer reviews using natural language processing techniques. I used NLTK and Scikit-Learn for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The project includes a Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations.

**Technologies Used:** Python, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Project 5: Time Series Forecasting

**Description:** This project explores time series forecasting using Facebook's Prophet library. I applied it to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis and forecasting process.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Prophet, Time Series Analysis.
